# Provision certificate authority
In order to generate the certificates needed by Kubernetes, you must first provision a certificate authority. This lesson will guide
you through the process of provisioning a new certificate authority for your Kubernetes cluster. After completing this lesson, you
should have a certificate authority, which consists of two files: **ca-key.pem** and **ca.pem** .
Here are the commands used in the demo:
```
cd ~/
mkdir kthw
cd kthw/
```

- UPDATE: cfssljson and cfssl will need to be installed. To install, complete the following commands:
```
sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssl https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl_linux-amd64
sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssljson https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssljson_linux-amd64
sudo curl -s -L -o /bin/cfssl-certinfo https://pkg.cfssl.org/R1.2/cfssl-certinfo_linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /bin/cfssl*
```

- Use this command to generate the certificate authority. Include the opening and closing curly braces to run this entire block as
a single command.
```
{
cat > ca-config.json << EOF
{
    "signing": {
        "default": {
            "expiry": "8760h"
    },
    "profiles": {
        "kubernetes": {
            "usages": ["signing", "key encipherment", "server auth", "client auth"],
            "expiry": "8760h"
        }
    }
    }
}
EOF
cat > ca-csr.json << EOF
{
    "CN": "Kubernetes",
    "key": {
        "algo": "rsa",
        "size": 2048
    },
    "names": [
        {
            "C": "US",
            "L": "Portland",
            "O": "Kubernetes",
            "OU": "CA",
            "ST": "Oregon"
        }
    ]
}
EOF
cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
}
```

This will generate the following files
- ca.csr 
- ca-key.pem   this is the private certificate for our authority
- ca.pem       this is the public certificate
 we care about the pem files.

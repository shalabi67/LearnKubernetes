# This manifest of an NGINX deployment has four replicas and the selector label app=frontend.
# The deployment has a PodAntiAffinity stanza configured that will ensure that the scheduler does not colocate replicas on a single node.
#  This ensures that if a node fails, there are still enough replicas of NGINX to serve data from its cache.
